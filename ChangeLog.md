Keep track of changes you've made by date here:

* 12/9/22
  * Almost done with sprite animation ant the bottom
  * next class: I want to finish the animation code and try to get started on the cards
* 12/13/22
  * I finished my basic sprite animation and made the files for my scoreboard and cards, but wasn't able to add any code yet.
  * next class: I want to get started on the matching game
* 12/15/22
  * I looked at some coding examples for matching games, but I wasn't able to create any cpde for my game
  * next class: I wanna be able to ask Mr. Hinkle for some help on where to start for my game, and hopefully i'll be able to finish it within the next two or three classes
* 12/16/22
  * I've got the basics of my card game into my code thanks to Mr Hinkle and have an idea of what I want to show on my cards. Next class I want to be able to have both my guy in the corner and have the cards, as well as work on having the cards stay shown when matched and get a scoreboard up.
* 12/19/22
  * I was able to make my guy appear with the card game, but I still haven't been able to improve the actual card game yet since I don't know the code for the if-statement I need to be able to get the cards to still show after matching. 
* 12/21/22
  * I was able to improve my cardgame, so now it has a counter for the moves you make and the cards stay open when matched. 
* 12/22/22
  * I didn't get to finish much since i left early, but I do have a game and sprite animation implemented, so in the remaining classes I plan on getting help on making the sprite react.
